# Mars-Weather-App
an app following the weather patterns on mars

using this project to learn about APIs and further my knowledge/understanding in javascript



this code is hiding our previous weather data 

``` .sr-only:not(:focus):not(:active) {
     clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
     clip-path: inset(50%);
     height: 1px;
     overflow: hidden;
     position: absolute;
     white-space: nowrap;
     width: 1px;
    }
```

this is some great documentation on it here: https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html
